          Small, compact, and hardy, Beagles are active companions for kids and
          adults alike. Canines of this dog breed are merry and fun loving, but
          being hounds, they can also be stubborn and require patient, creative
          training techniques. Their noses guide them through life, and they’re
          never happier than when following an interesting scent. Beagles
          originally were bred as scenthounds to track small game, mostly
          rabbits and hare. They’re still used for this purpose in many
          countries today, including the United States. But you’ll find plenty
          of these pups living as companion dogs and loving, furry family
          members. <a href="pet2.html#b1">Read more</a>

            The Labrador Retriever was bred to be both a friendly companion and a useful working dog breed. Historically, they earned their keep as fishermen’s helpers: hauling nets, fetching ropes, and retrieving fish from the chilly North Atlantic.

            Today’s Lab is as good-natured and hardworking as their ancestors, and they’re also America’s most popular breed. Modern Labs work as retrievers for hunters, assistance dogs, show competitors, and search and rescue dogs, among other canine jobs.

            Doberman Pinschers originated in Germany during the late 19th century, mostly bred as guard dogs. Their exact ancestry is unknown, but they’re believed to be a mixture of many dog breeds, including the Rottweiler, Black and Tan Terrier, and German Pinscher.
With their sleek coat, athletic build, and regal appearance, this pup looks like an aristocrat. They’re highly energetic and smart dogs who perform well in police and military work, canine sports, and as family guardians and companions.

            Pugs often are described as a lot of dog in a small space. These sturdy, compact dogs are a part of the American Kennel Club’s Toy group, and are known as the clowns of the canine world because they have a great sense of humor and like to show off. Originally bred to be a lap dog, the Pug thrives on human companionship.
