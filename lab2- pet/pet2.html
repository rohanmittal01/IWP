            Beagles come in two basic sizes.
            Some are about 13 inches tall or under and weigh about 18 pounds (eight kilograms); the second size group is from 13 to 15 inches in height and weighs about 20 pounds (nine kilograms).
            Beagles are muscular, solid dogs with a slightly domed skull. Their muzzle is squarish and the nose broad. Ears are long and droopy. Their chest is deep, back is straight and they have a moderately long tail that is carried high. The breed's smooth, dense coat is usually black, tan, and white.
            <h5>Living with</h5>
            Beagles are active, curious dogs. They are also hound dogs, so it's in their nature to roam. Care must be taken to prevent them from wandering off into harm's way by keeping them contained in a fenced-in yard or on a leash when outside of the house.
            Beagles also are friendly little dogs. Don't depend on them to guard your house. They may bark, but are unlikely to do much more than wag their tails if confronted with an intruder.
            Their short coat is remarkably easy to care for and requires minimal grooming and only occasional bathing. Once past puppyhood, some beagles seem to easily become overweight, so watch the caloric intake. The beagle's life expectancy is about 12 years.

            Labrador retrievers are sturdy, solid dogs. They are almost square in appearance, with a strong body and sturdy legs. 
            The maximum height for a male is 24 inches, which puts them in the medium-size dog category, but their sturdy build can make them seem much larger. 
            Weights range from 85 pounds for a large male to 55 pounds for a smaller female. Field line bred dogs are often taller and somewhat thinner in build. 
            Labrador retrievers are easily recognized by their broad head, drop ears and large, expressive eyes. 
            Two trademarks of the Lab are the thick but fairly short double coat, which is very water repellent, and the well known "otter tail." T
            he tail is thick and sturdy and comes off the topline almost straight. The feet are described as "webbed," with longer skin between the toes to aid in swimming. 
            Color can range from black through chocolate to a red/yellow or even almost white.
            The Labrador retriever is a moderately fast maturing breed, reaching adult height from six to 12 months, but possibly still filling out up to 2 years of age. Many Labs reach 12 to 14 years of age.
            <h5>Living with</h5>
            Obviously, Labradors have a number of endearing traits or they would not be so popular. They are intelligent and fairly easy to train, partly from their desire to work with people. They are "easy keepers" and can become overweight if they are not exercised and food portions adjusted as needed. Labs are excellent family dogs because they do want to be with people and many do not do well as kennel dogs.
            Labradors do tend to be protective of their families and homes but are usually happy to greet company, too. With the strong retrieving instinct, they can develop into destructive chewers if not given appropriate toys and guidance. Labs may tend to "mouth" people and the solution is often simply to give them a toy to carry around, so their mouths are already full! These are very strong dogs and early training is necessary to have a dog that walks nicely on lead.
            The wonderful double coat that keeps the Labrador warm while retrieving in icy water also gives this breed top billing as shedders. Normally, their coats do fine with a quick weekly grooming, but at shedding time daily grooming is needed. The amount of exercise they need varies with the different lines: field line dogs can run all day, whereas show line dogs only need moderate exercise.

            Males are about 27 or 28 inches tall and weigh about 70 pounds (32 kilograms), while females are an inch or two shorter and weigh about 60 to 65 pounds (27 to 29 kilograms).
            The Doberman pinscher has a long head and a sleek, muscular body. The ears are often cropped to stand erect, and the tail is usually docked short.
            The Doberman pinscher has a short, sleek and shiny coat that is black, dark red, blue or fawn with rust-colored markings on the face, body and tail. This dog is an average shedder and requires minimal grooming. Dobermans live about 10 to 12 years.
          <h5>Living with</h5>
            Doberman pinschers are powerful, energetic dogs that need lots of exercise. If they are not exercised, they are more likely to become irritable or even aggressive. They can adjust well to apartment living if exercised daily.
            Careful socialization and obedience training from a young age are essential for this breed. Doberman pinschers respond very well to positive reinforcement.
            No special guard training is needed for anyone who wants a good family protector. In fact, Doberman pinscher experts often advise against special guard training, which could result in over-guarding and aggression.

            The first impression of a rottweiler is of solid strength, and that is quite accurate.
            Rottweilers are slightly longer than tall, large dogs, ranging in height from 22 inches for a small female to 27 inches for a large male. Weights go from 80 to 120+ pounds (36 to 54+ kilograms).
            Rottweilers are blocky dogs with massive heads. Ears lie fairly tight to the head, hanging down somewhat. Muzzles are square and strong, but rottweilers can be a bit drooly because of loose flews (lips). Rottweilers should always be black with tan points, and the ideal coat is quite short, dense, and a bit harsh. Occasionally a "fluffy" puppy will turn up in a litter, but that coat is disqualified in the breed ring. Tails are docked very short, ideally one to two vertebrae long.
            As is common with the larger breeds, rottweilers can be slow maturing. Many do not reach full adult size until 2 or 3 years of age, although adult height is often set by one year of age. These dogs will fill out, broadening their chests and becoming the massive dogs we expect with age.
            <h5>Living with</h5>
            Rottweilers are fairly easy to keep for such large dogs and, in fact, have a tendency to obesity if not exercised enough. Coat care is minimal; a quick, weekly grooming will suffice most of the time. Some rottweilers do drool a fair amount, especially large males with loose flews (lips).
            One of the most important things to remember with rottweilers is that they need extensive and continuous socialization to be good family companions. Training is a must and should start in early puppy hood. Their courage is unquestioned, but it can be misdirected. This breed is not an ideal one for first-time dog owners. Rottweilers love to work and will happily compete in virtually all dog sports from obedience to herding and weight pulls.
            Ideally, a rottweiler will be exposed to other pets, including dogs, right from the start, and also to children. Rottweilers are often very protective of their children and should be supervised when with a group of children. This breed is definitely one that should only be purchased from a reputable breeder, because its popularity has led to some temperament and health problems. Rottweilers live about 12 years.

            Pugs are members of the toy group despite their solid appearance.
            They range in height from 10 to 11 inches and in weight from 14 to 18 pounds (six to eight kilograms). They are square dogs with substantial limbs. Pugs are the sturdiest dogs of the toy group, befitting their mastiff heritage.
            Pugs are known for their large, round heads, with the shortened muzzles and extensive forehead wrinkles. The vertical wrinkle on the forehead is said to resemble the Chinese character for "prince" and thus known as the "prince mark." The eyes protrude somewhat, making them prone to trauma. The tail curls tightly over the hip.
            They have a short, but very dense double coat. Colors can range from apricot to fawn, silver and black. All but the black dogs have a dark mask and ears with a trace of darkening down the back. The ears feel like black velvet.
            <h5>Living with</h5>
            Pugs are extremely easy to keep and have a serious tendency to become obese unless their diet and exercise are watched carefully. With the short muzzle, they do not do well in hot, humid weather and must be observed carefully for heatstroke. Pugs do tend to snore, again a result of the short muzzle. The prominent eyes are easily injured and care must be taken to keep them moist. Pugs are fairly robust and often live to 14 or 15 years of age.
            Pugs do best with some daily exercise to help with their weight problems. Despite their heroic alarm years ago, they are not usually great watchdogs, preferring instead to greet newcomers with a wagging tail. Pugs should be socialized to keep that outgoing temperament, and they do well with other pets.
            Grooming is important, both for the shedding from the dense coat and to keep facial wrinkles clean. A quick daily grooming, even a swipe with a hound mitt, usually suffices for the coat and a gentle wiping with a wet cloth for the face.
