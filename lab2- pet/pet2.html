            Labrador retrievers are sturdy, solid dogs. They are almost square in appearance, with a strong body and sturdy legs. 
            The maximum height for a male is 24 inches, which puts them in the medium-size dog category, but their sturdy build can make them seem much larger. 
            Weights range from 85 pounds for a large male to 55 pounds for a smaller female. Field line bred dogs are often taller and somewhat thinner in build. 
            Labrador retrievers are easily recognized by their broad head, drop ears and large, expressive eyes. 
            Two trademarks of the Lab are the thick but fairly short double coat, which is very water repellent, and the well known "otter tail." T
            he tail is thick and sturdy and comes off the topline almost straight. The feet are described as "webbed," with longer skin between the toes to aid in swimming. 
            Color can range from black through chocolate to a red/yellow or even almost white.
            The Labrador retriever is a moderately fast maturing breed, reaching adult height from six to 12 months, but possibly still filling out up to 2 years of age. Many Labs reach 12 to 14 years of age.
            <h5>Living with</h5>
            Obviously, Labradors have a number of endearing traits or they would not be so popular. They are intelligent and fairly easy to train, partly from their desire to work with people. They are "easy keepers" and can become overweight if they are not exercised and food portions adjusted as needed. Labs are excellent family dogs because they do want to be with people and many do not do well as kennel dogs.

Labradors do tend to be protective of their families and homes but are usually happy to greet company, too. With the strong retrieving instinct, they can develop into destructive chewers if not given appropriate toys and guidance. Labs may tend to "mouth" people and the solution is often simply to give them a toy to carry around, so their mouths are already full! These are very strong dogs and early training is necessary to have a dog that walks nicely on lead.

The wonderful double coat that keeps the Labrador warm while retrieving in icy water also gives this breed top billing as shedders. Normally, their coats do fine with a quick weekly grooming, but at shedding time daily grooming is needed. The amount of exercise they need varies with the different lines: field line dogs can run all day, whereas show line dogs only need moderate exercise.

            The Rottweiler was originally dogs bred to drive cattle to market. Later they were used to pull carts for butchers. They were among the earliest police dogs and serve with honor in the military.

Most important, they are popular family guardians and friends. Novice pet parents should beware, as these dogs are strong and intense. They need experienced care and training. Consistent, energetic pet parents will find a loving, faithful, and intelligent friend for life in a Rottie!

            Pugs often are described as a lot of dog in a small space. These sturdy, compact dogs are a part of the American Kennel Clubâ€™s Toy group, and are known as the clowns of the canine world because they have a great sense of humor and like to show off. Originally bred to be a lap dog, the Pug thrives on human companionship.
